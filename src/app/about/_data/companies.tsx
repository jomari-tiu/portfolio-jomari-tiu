          As a Frontend Developer, I am responsible for bringing digital ideas
          to life through clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My
          work involves maintaining existing projects to ensure smooth
          functionality and performance, as well as adding new features that
          enhance the overall user experience. I also create projects from
          scratch, translating concepts and designs into fully functional web
          applications. Collaboration is a key part of my role—I work closely
          with designers to achieve visually consistent results, coordinate with
          backend developers to integrate APIs and data, and communicate with
          project managers to meet timelines and deliver high-quality outcomes.
          My goal is to build efficient, maintainable, and visually appealing
          interfaces that meet both user and business needs.
