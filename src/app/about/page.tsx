            I&apos;m Jomari Tiu, a passionate Frontend Developer with over four
            years of experience in the software development industry. My
            expertise lies in building high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly
            web and mobile applications using technologies like Next.js,
            React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Expo React
            Native.
          </p>
          <p>
            While my primary focus is frontend development, I also have hands-on
            experience as a Junior Backend Developer, working with Express.js,
            NestJS, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, and Prisma to design and maintain
            efficient server-side systems. I enjoy bridging the gap between
            design and functionality to create seamless user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to web and app development, I&apos;ve also built
            automation systems, such as Telegram bots, that improve workflows
            and save time for both users and businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I&apos;m someone who believes in continuous growth
            â€” whether it&apos;s improving my programming skills, working out,
            playing games, riding motorcycles, or building model kits. These
            hobbies help me stay creative, disciplined, and motivated in
            everything I do.
